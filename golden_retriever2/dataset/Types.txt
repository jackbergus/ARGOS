ASPIC: defines the notions of an argument, argument ordering, attack and defeat, 
and the representation in the AIF leverages those definitions, as the AIF itself
is largely agnostic about the exact ‘semantics’ of the represented notions.

Terminology of Rule Application: RA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inferences (and arguments)
* take any number of incoming edges and have as their target the I-node representing the abstract argument
* combination of RA-nodes and their predecessors and successors in AIF

Attack nodes : AA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defeat nodes : DA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conflict Scheme Application: CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Represent conflicts between elemenfs of AIF

Rephrase: MA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Semantic proximity between propositional content

Preference Application: (PA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Preference of one I-/S-node over another
* between two initial I-nodes or between two RA-nodes
* preferences in ASPIC between either elements of the knowledge base or defeasible inference rules, respectively

Transitions between Locutions: (TA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

: (YA)
~~~~~~
to L-nodes and TA-nodes
